# fish_assistant
_Google assistant API hooked up to a Raspberry PI in a Big Mouth Billy Bass_

Ideal shamelessly stolen from Brian Kane for a gift idea.

Code is basically taken from https://github.com/googlesamples/assistant-sdk-python/tree/master/google-assistant-grpc

Main file is `fish.py` which extends some of the classes in the sample code, and adds the RPI.GPIO motor, led, and button control.
